# Caren Fitbit Syncer
## https://caren-universe.herokuapp.com/

For this to function, you need to have a Caren and a Fitbit account.

* https://www.fitbit.com/

This application will demonstrate a great possibility that can be accomplished by using the Caren API. In this case the Fitbit wearable will be linked with the Caren account. By this way the steps (which are being measured by Fitbit) will be visible in the Caren user's dossier.

Currently when signing in with your Caren credentials and linking your Fitbit account, the Caren Fitbit Syncer will request the amount of steps you have walked in the last 30 days and show them in your personal Caren dossier. Next to that, you will be able to sync manually to retrieve the most accurate data.
